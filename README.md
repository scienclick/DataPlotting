# Data Plotting and Visualization

written by Mehdi Paydayesh, 24/04/2019


## Motivation

This notebook can be used as a reference for data plotting and visualization. Popular Python data plotting libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn as well as pandas built-in functions are used for plotting the same data. The user should be able to familiarize himself/herself with various syntax in different libraries. Hope you enjoy this notebook and have fun with it ;)

## Usage example

This repository is going to be a recording place for typical steps in data plotting, and everyone can benefit from. 

## Requirements

The major libraries used in these projects are:
1. numpy,
2. pandas,
3. seaborn,
4. matplotlib,



## File structure

I have used a dataset called *tips.csv* in this project which contains tips data for a waiter over a period of a few months working in one restaurant. He collected several variables: tip, bill, sex of bill payer, whether there were smokers in the party, day of the week, time of day, size of the party. The source of the data is: Bryant, P. G. and Smith, M. A. (1995), Practical Data Analysis: Case Studies in Business Statistics, Richard D. Irwin Publishing, Homewood, IL.
Please note that any other data set can be used instead. The notebook file is called **DataPlotting.ipynb** and includes the following sections:

**Part 0: importing libararies**

**Part 1: loading data**

**Part 2: getting some statistics out of the data**

**Part 3: Pandas bulitIn plotting**

**Part 4: Accessing the individual columns in the data frame**

**Part 5: Data grouping**

**Part 6: Seaborn plotting**

**Part 7: Matplotlib plotting**
